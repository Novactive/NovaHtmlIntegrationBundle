Novactive eZ Static Templates bundle is an eZ Platform bundle providing an ultra easy way to access twig templates from an url.

It uses the [siteaccess](https://doc.ezplatform.com/en/latest/guide/siteaccess/) and the [design engine](https://doc.ezplatform.com/en/latest/guide/design_engine/) provided by eZ Platform.

## Features

When you access a siteaccess in the siteaccess group `static_group`, it will take the url and show the twig template having the corresponding path.

You can configure as many siteaccess as you want, and using the design engine you can configure a different theme for each siteaccess.

As we are using the siteaccess feature, u can also use the [permissions](https://doc.ezplatform.com/en/latest/guide/permissions/) to control the access.

### Example

Considering a theme `static_test`, a siteaccess `static-test` is automatically generated. The siteaccess is then matched by URI, the url `http://localhost/static-test/news/details` will show the template in `themes\static_test\news\details.html.twig`

That's it!

## Installation

### Get the bundle

Run `composer require novactive/ezstatictemplatesbundle` to install the bundle and its dependencies.

       ...
       new Novactive\Bundle\EzStaticTemplatesBundle\EzStaticTemplatesBundle(),
